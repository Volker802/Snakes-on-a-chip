# Snakes-on-a-chip

Snake Gmae on ESP32-Wemos-Lolin32 (With inbuilt SSD1306 OLED module). Uses MPU6050 to control direction of snake.
Places where I acquired different libraries:
SSD1306 library: https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306.
MPU6050 library: https://github.com/imxieyi/esp32-i2c-mpu6050.
Snake game library: https://github.com/carljohanlandin/snake.

To Do:
1. Increase speed/runtime of the game. This is an issue that significantly reduces the run time of the game. Also compounded by the fact that there are so many pixels to cover. Perhaps in future the size of snake and food must be increased.

2. Significant code clean-up.
